# LCS Algorithm Visualizer

**LCS Algorithm Visualizer** is a professional, interactive web application designed to help users understand and explore the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Longest Common Substring algorithms. This tool provides a dynamic visualization of the dynamic programming (DP) table, allowing users to follow each computational step and trace the optimal solution path.
